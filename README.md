# FINAL


PART I --> General Info & EDA for 1 mio review

PART II --> DataPreprocessing & ngrams & wordlouds

          --> undersampling approach
          --> application on two datasets (imbalanced but larger, balanced but smaller)


PART III ---> Lexicon Based analysis by VADER and Texblob for both undersampling and imbalance datasets

PART IV --> Vectorizer and Machine learning
          
        --->BOW + ML : Countvectorizer + HashingVectorizer + Ngram

        ---> TF-IDF + ML
        ---> Doc2vec + Deeplearning with word2vec functions
